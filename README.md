# Simple Template Importer for Obsidian

A simple plugin that allows you to install template vaults more easily in your own vault.

I got frustrated with the number of steps it takes to install templates into an existing Obsidian vault, and this is my solution.

The workflow goes like this:

- Install this plugin from Community Plugins
- Download a template vault in the form of a .zip file
- Open the command palette, search for "Import Files from Zip", and select your zip file.
- You're done!

I wish Obsidian had one-click installation of templates, like Notion does. But until they do, this will have to do.

This plugin just imports files from a Zip file, but it also finds any .css files that exist and automatically installs them to the .obsidian/snippets directory.
